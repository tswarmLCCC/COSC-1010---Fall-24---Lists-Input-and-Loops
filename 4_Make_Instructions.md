## What's a 'Make' Task?

In these tasks you have to use the skills learned in the previous exercises to create a new program based on the requirements below.

## Task Instructions - Class List
Write a program that:
- Stores 10 names in a list 
- Asks the user to input 1 to choose output range, 2 to choose output from a point to the end of the list or 3 to choose output from the beginning of the list to a point.
- Validates the input and does not continue until it is suitable. 
- Depending on the option chosen asks the user to input relevant start/end points.
- Outputs the relevant items from the list.

### Extra challenge 
- code the three different outputs as separate subroutines and call them when needed.

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- Square brackets for items in the list
- Commas between each item in the list.
- String items are in quotation marks
- Range - the end value is NOT included in the output.
- Search - not initialising counter OUTSIDE the loop.
- Search - not incrementing counter INSIDE the loop.
