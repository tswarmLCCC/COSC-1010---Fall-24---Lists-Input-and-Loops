# Predict and Run

## Whatâ€™s a **Predict & Run** task?

In these tasks you will be given one or more examples of code.

- Look at each example , study it carefully.  
- Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs.  Your prediction should be added to the code as comments.
- Run the code, compare what happens to your prediction.
- Add comments to note down and differences between your prediction and what actually happened.

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- Square brackets for items in the list
- Commas between each item in the list.
- String items are in quotation marks
- Range - the end value is NOT included in the output.
- Search - not initialising counter OUTSIDE the loop.
- Search - not incrementing counter INSIDE the loop.
