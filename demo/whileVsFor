'''
for loops: Used for iterating over a fixed sequence of items.
When to Use:
When the number of iterations is predetermined (e.g., iterating over a list, range, or other iterable).
When you know the exact number of times you want to execute the loop.
OR - you want to run forever!  (Games use this!)
'''

#an example
animals = ['cow', 'chicken', 'cat', 'dog']
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)

'''
While Loop: Repeatedly executes a block of statements while a condition remains true.
When to Use:
    When the number of iterations is not predetermined.
    When you need to repeat a task until a specific condition becomes false.
    When you want more flexibility in initialization within the loop body.
    Sentinel Values can be useful for code clarity
